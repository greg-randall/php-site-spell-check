# php-site-spell-check
This tool does an in-page spellcheck. It will highlight misspelled words in red and list the misspelled words at the bottom of the page.

I'm sure there are some edge cases that this tool does not work on. 
There are also some pages that this tool breaks visually.

For entering custom spell check words, add one word per line to custom-dict.txt.
